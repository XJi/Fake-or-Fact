<p>Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is a controversial character. But there&#8217;s no denying the emails he has picked up from inside the Democrat Party are real, and he&#8217;s willing to expose Hillary Clinton.</p><div class="insert_post_ads col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><div id="imkIncontent1"></div></div><div class="insert_post_ads col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><div id="imkInlineDesktop"></div></div>
<p>Now, he&#8217;s announcing that Hillary Clinton and her State Department were actively arming Islamic jihadists, which includes the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria.</p>
<p>Clinton has repeatedly denied these claims, including during multiple statements while under oath in front of the United States Senate.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks is about to prove Hillary Clinton deserves to be arrested:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Reagan administration officials hoped to secure the release of several U.S. hostages, and then take proceeds from the arms sales to Iran, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Sounds familiar?</p>
<p>In Obama’s second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan/Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria.</p>
<p>Clinton took the lead role in organizing the so-called “Friends of Syria” (aka Al Qaeda/ISIS) to back the CIA-led insurgency for regime change in Syria.</p>
<p>Under oath Hillary Clinton denied she knew about the weapons shipments during public testimony in early 2013 after the Benghazi terrorist attack.</p>
<p>In an interview with Democracy Now, Wikileaks’ Julian Assange is now stating that 1,700 emails contained in the Clinton cache directly connect Hillary to Libya to Syria, and directly to Al Qaeda and ISIS.</p></blockquote>
<p>Via <a href="http://theduran.com/julian-assange-says-1700-emails-hillary-clintons-collection-proves-sold-weapons-isis-syria/" target="_blank">The Duran</a></p>
<p>Here is the incredible transcript:</p>
<blockquote><p>JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Julian, I want to mention something else. In March, you launched a searchable archive for over 30,000 emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary Clinton’s private email server while she was secretary of state. The 50,547 pages of documents span the time from June 2010 to August 2014; 7,500 of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton herself. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Why did you do this, and what’s the importance, from your perspective, of being able to create a searchable base?</p>
<p>JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, WikiLeaks has become the rebel library of Alexandria. It is the single most significant collection of information that doesn’t exist elsewhere, in a searchable, accessible, citable form, about how modern institutions actually behave. And it’s gone on to set people free from prison, where documents have been used in their court cases; hold the CIA accountable for renditions programs; feed into election cycles, which have resulted in the termination of, in some case—or contributed to the termination of governments, in some cases, taken the heads of intelligence agencies, ministers of defense and so on. So, you know, our civilizations can only be as good as our knowledge of what our civilisation is. We can’t possibly hope to reform that which we do not understand.</p>
<p>So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that’s there in those emails. There’s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton’s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vnWWgKxWvtY" width="628" height="330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>It appears that Hillary Clinton committed perjury, just like her husband was caught doing as President.</p>

<p>Julian Assange has lost ALL credibility since he has proven he is nothing but a man available to the highest bidder and a tool for the Kremlin. Its MORE likely that ASSANGE himself fabricated and falsified to give an appearance of wrong-doing. INDEED its likely tha5t Assange also fabricated ALL of the allegedly released e-mails himself. THAT is why he could not release the e-mails but instead dribbled them out piecemeal, he had to have time to write them all himself.</p>

<p>Your comment reflects the gist of the double-handful of super-rich, elite owners of the six companies that control 96% of the western world media. These families continue to support the evil Obama-Clinton-DNC subterfuge while defaming Mr. Trump and entourage.<br/>
The narcissism of the &#8220;Samson Option&#8221; is reflected by the elite families and their subterfuge via the Obama-Clinton-DNC organization, to include your robot-type of comment.</p>

<p>&#8230;the rest of us would have been tarred and feathered for such an &#8220;error&#8221; (mishandling of correspondence on an unauthorized system)&#8230;furthermore the claim that she &#8220;was unaware&#8221; that the mails were sensitive in any way is nonsense. The rest of us would have been told that ignorance of the law does not equal innocence&#8230;I am certain she had to sign a waiver of some sort upon taking office as secretary of state to maintain whatever state secrets she would come in to contact with. This assumes knowledge of what is confidential and what is not. She&#8217;s lying and hoping everything will be delayed until she is elected, after which she will have considerably more control and manipulative influence, making the majority of the evidence available, &#8220;disappear&#8221;. It&#8217;s been done before, and we voters have been duped repeatedly in the past.</p>
<p>There is no need to wish for violence against her, when the truth can just as effectively destroy her.</p>
<p>While I do not support Trump (he&#8217;s kind of a buffoon), I do feel a bit of sympathy for his campaign in that facing HRC and all of her poli-influence is tantamount to scaling a perfectly vertical and smooth rock wall without tools&#8230;here&#8217;s an idea&#8230;vote for me instead.</p>

<p>Hillary is the WORST possible choice. She has proven her incompetence time and time again. The rest of the world laughs at the possibility she will &#8220;lead&#8221; America. She has a s^&amp;t bag of a husband and defends him for her own political gain. Shame on ANYONE who votes for her. </p>

<p>Debunked by truthorfiction? Wikileaks has been proven to be accurate. Democrats can&#8217;t believe because they lie and they think everyone else lies too. I never thought I would believe Assange would be my hero but he has become the beacon of truth. </p>

debunked? You&#8217;d have a better change arguing the world is flat. But, then again, HRC would tell the world it is on live TV.</p>
<p>If the USA elects HRC, $0.02 much of the world is going to war vs. the USA over her. Watch. What this b!tch has done is not only stupid as h3ll, it&#8217;s national suicide for the U.S. to not ditch her asap.</p>

<p>Whether she is Sec of State or not, the sale of American weapons to a country who thrives on Islamic jihadism is wrong, consists of a traitor to the US, and should be prosecuted as such. </p>
<p>My worrisome question&#8230;why is she still leading in the polls and why will she most assuredly be elected as president&#8230;that&#8217;s what happens in corruption&#8230;they make their money by being traitors, liars, murderers of anyone who knows too much and is not committed to the scheme as they should be. This is not the Clinton&#8217;s first ride&#8230;their hands have been dirty since Arkansas days. And now they are going back to the White House for the third term and not one darn person has the guts to stand up and do anything about it. Any other unknown soul would have been in prison for decades. </p>
<p>For example, look at what Martha Stewart did, compared to the Clinton&#8217;s and all of their DNC and Hillary&#8217;s close staff while she was Sec. of State, and not one has been indicted. They sit before Trey Gowdy with that s&#8211;t-eating grin on the face and plead the 5th. </p>
<p>And what happened when a subpoena was issued for all the emails and blackberries and even the server, they destroyed knowing they were under subpoena&#8230;who does that and is running for president and will be elected as our new president because the majority of the people are too stupid to really care&#8230;they just want a &#8220;woman president&#8221;&#8230;stupid, simple-minded people.</p>

<p>She is in no way leading in the polls they are going to insert her like they did the Kenyan POS. Then it is on and we do this the way it must be done. WE PHYSICALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK. iT WILL BE A GLORIOUS DEATH. BUT WELL WORTH IT TO SAVE THIS COUNTRY.</p>

<p>She was Sec of State during the overthrow of Libya, which is when the sales took place. Benghazi followed later, which I&#8217;m sure they let Ambassador Stevens die to hide the weapons trafficking as he was a part of that. Clintons don&#8217;t like loose ends.</p>

<p>Julian Assange does not falsify documents. His track record is exemplary. That&#8217;s so many people want him killed and why he has been the Ecuadorian embassy for four years. The second he steps out of there, he is going to the big house. Just ask Debbie Blabbermouth Shultz how &#8220;wrong&#8221; he is.</p>

<p>I always thought that the harvesting of the parts of aborted children was sold to cannibals as a delicacy. By the way didn&#8217;t obama once live in Indonesia where they eat monkeys. The US abortion harvesting business is a step up for him. I wonder if hillary joined him for dinner? Probably did &#8211; that was her inauguration into allahism.</p>

<p>I am getting so tired of Hillary supporter not wanting to listen to reason or use common sense or even belive cold hard facts when they are presented with them.I am very worried about America I have children and grandchildren that I want to go up in a safe and prosperous world not a &#8220;global community&#8221;.Socialism does not work never has never will it is a fact.Liberals are looking at a fairytale world that has been made up by those in power to keep them quiet and happy until it is too late for anyone to change things.I know as I sit here typing this that only a few will understand or even care Please do some reading and research do not take my or anyone person&#8217;s word for things ,don&#8217;t be lazy for God&#8217;s sake it is your country and your future put a little work into your thoughts and beliefs.Good luck and I wish you well.</p>

<p>MSNBC has uncovered evidence that wikileaks is releasing falsified emails. Combined with the irrefutable fact that she hasn&#8217;t actually been involved with the government in any way, shape or form since before ISIS even came to be 3 years ago confirms that.</p>

<p>It is probably more likely that MSNBC manufactured evidence and created a false story to try and discredit WikiLeaks. MSNBC exhibits far left/progressive views, not to mention their devotion to the Clinton campaign, and Wiki has been a &#8216;thorn in their side&#8217; for years publishing articles that the news media have tried to cover up and keep the people of the US from finding out. A lot of this information is old, being reported on years ago in foreign news sources. All that happened here is a corroboration of what was reported in the Daily Mail and other newspapers around the world with a few of the details filled in.</p>

<p>You are talking about MSNBC &#8211; one of the Clinton networks. How do you trust ANYTHING they say on something as serious as this. Read this about Benghazi: So here&#8217;s the REAL story. Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn&#8217;t arm the missile and the Chinook didn&#8217;t explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a &#8220;do-or-die&#8221; mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn&#8217;t supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK&#8217;d the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason&#8230;and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further&#8230;the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn&#8230;everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised&#8230;and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in&#8230;because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers<br/>
The above was copied and pasted. I cannot believe you HC supporters are sooooooo stupid &#8211; you refuse to see what is right before your eyes. If HC gets in THERE WILL NOT BE A UNITED STATES OF AMERICA any more. She wants hemispheric globalization which means NO MORE US BORDERS AT ALL. There will be all the criminals, drug lords and cartel people coming up from Central America. The USA will have a takeover by the muslims and shariah law will be established and if that&#8217;s what you want keep that pea brain of yours closed and don&#8217;t think for yourself.</p>

<p>You are correct Sally and the latest data &#8220;dumps&#8221; prove it. Along with the FACT that HRC is a paid traitor by Israel and other countries,that want a dumbed down &#8220;more compliant&#8221; populace. Unfortunately,the distractions are working for them!<br/>
Isreal owns the USA and everything we do is sanctioned by them.</p>

<p>Please reference your statement. We all know Hypocrite. Hillary is a liar so I question the integrity of anyone who supports her. Did you know she was on the crack team working to prosecute Nixon for seven minutes of tape. And she erased how many emails? What a hypocrite. I guess the left is going to have to using Watergate as a propaganda tool.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s her famous line: &#8220;I know nothing.&#8221; Her husband, too. He never inhaled the pot, he never had sex with those women. They never trashed the White House before George W.

<p>You better get more than one garbage truck, because just cleaning out the white house is not enough, you would have to make a clean sweep of just about all government institutions and branches, they are full of corruption and back room dealings, People in any position of power just look after them selves first and foremost, and if the public should benefit, well that&#8217;s by accident.</p>

<p>WOW! So many anti everything people here! Does anyone even believe that WIKILEAKS is still credible after they were found to be distributing altered emails as the real thing? Oh, not once but twice now. I believe they have just done another stupid thing and released a 3rd bunch and security people are already saying some have been poorly forged to look like the real thing. So sad, Sure hope Assange rots where he is because his rape case is not going away!</p>

<p>No, Wikileaks has never altered emails. They used scan-to-text to make the initial archives searchable which miss/mix letters here and there. The democrats even tried to blame the .goy email addresses as an anti-semitic Wikileaks plot. Hilarious considering any speech-to-text program will mistake .gov for .goy.</p>
<p>The rape case was already dropped after the people (us, not you) exposed the women involved as CIA tools who infiltrated Assange&#8217;s life. You are a fool for suggesting Wikileaks is not credible when they are the ones responsible for holding HIllary accountable for her degenerate actions in Libya and Syria.</p>

<p>There really isn&#8217;t much to be &#8220;pro&#8221; for when you have a bunch of political party Loyalist, gender loyalist and/or angry people making bad decisions based on emotion, not logic. This is the worst political race I have ever seen and both candidates are unfit to be president. Anyway, I don&#8217;t need wiki-leaks to be credible. James Comey dropped a bomb shell of incriminating evidence which were very serious. Stronger incriminating evidence than what was presented at a Grand Jury for OJ Simpson for murdering his wife. Has there been a Grand Jury for Hillary Clinton? Nope! But people fear Trump (and perhaps they should. I don&#8217;t trust him). The difference is, Trump talks a lot of bad things. Hillary has actually done a lot of bad things. The fact that she had the political muscle to escape facing a Grand Jury should be seriously alarming to anyone who values logic.</p>

<p>Why do so many gullible people still think that Julian Assange is guilty of rape? If you don&#8217;t know that it is a concocted allegation by the FBI to try and stop him from sharing the truth and embarrassing poor political buddies, then I guess you deserve to vote &#8216;hillary&#8217; and believe all her stupid deceptions, and then live with the consequences. Best of luck to you.<br/>
Also, Julian is not trying to sway the US election, but merely trying to expose corruption and those who put him in his predicament, jail in the embassy for so long. I hope he gets every one of them. One gets used to corruption when it comes to pure money, but when it puts people in jail for their own causes, then these people deserve to rot.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad Julian Assange is coming out with the truth. You people just want a woman president so bad that you believe all her lies and deceitfulness. We don&#8217;t owe her the satisfaction, we are not &#8220;Make a Wish&#8221; foundation for Hillary to become president. She needs to stay home and spend what time she has left with her grandchildren.</p>

<p>Hillary and Trump Were BOTH Chosen FOR US By The Corporations &amp; Billionaires!<br/>
They Use The Corporate Media As Their Tool To Manipulate US &amp; DEMAND That We Choose Between THEIR CHOSEN CANDIDATES!<br/>
The Trumps &amp; Clintons Are Friends &amp; Donald Will Definitely Sell Out The Public To The HIghest Bidder&#8230; If the Corporations Give Him What He Wants, He Will Give Them What They Want!<br/>

<p>CORRECTION: Trump has never been, isn&#8217;t now, nor likely will ever be of the CORRUPT ELITE<br/>
Do your homework. Since the early 80&#8217;s he has been at odds with the Elite corrupt Government ON RECORD and IN THEIR FACE.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not a bombshell, friend of Syria is an international group that operates just outside of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>It was started by the former French President to find a solution to the Syrian conflict after Russia and China vetoed the UN SC resolution.</p>
<p>the UK, France, Turkey&#8230; they were all a part of it.</p>
<p>There are only a dozen countries that are a part of it.</p>
<p>Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, UK, Qatar&#8230; the list goes on.<br/>
BOMBSHELL&#8230; this isn&#8217;t bombshell.</p>
<p>At least not to people who pay attention to what&#8217;s happening in the the world anyway&#8230;.</p>

<p>Johnson doesn&#8217;t actually have the balls to stand up to these corrupt politicians like Trump.<br/>
Trump speaks TRUTH. Everything we discuss today regarding immigrants / Politically Correct speech, thought, etc. has come about BECAUSE of Trump bringing awareness to it publicly. He has helped AWAKEN the masses that were silent and feeling ashamed for having simple feelings of survival. For whatever reason (I question not) God has chosen Donald J. Trump as his vessel to deliver The United States of America from the evils of this corrupt government. I am grateful, humbled, and feeling blessed.</p>
<p>But if you want to see Johnson in a HERO role against Hillary I know where you Can view that&#8230;<br/>
Citizens For honest Government created a fascinating documentary in 1994 called The Clinton Chronicles, Gary and Hillary star in it 🙂 Hint: He&#8217;s the good guy! The protector&#8230;<br/>

<p>Yes, she served one term and in that term she made all the provisions to sell arms, thus, Benghazi happened! It might help if you stay with your opinions in your own country.</p>

<p>Right after the Benghazi event, a Canadian source wrote that the reason our ambassador was in Benghazi rather than Tripoli was to meet with Turkish military liason, who informed him that the Russians were aware of the gunrunning operation out of Benghazi, and that the &#8220;jig was up&#8221;. Easy for the Russians to hire proxies to attack the compound and disrupt operations. The reason the CIA was ordered to stand down was fear that their presence would reveal the gunrunning operation. Better our citizens die than cause embarrassment for Obama and HRC.<br/>
Which leads to the realization that Putin has BHO and HRC by the short hairs, and can blackmail them forever. Which is why we have not attempted to counter any of Russia&#8217;s moves in Ukraine or Syria.</p>

<p>&#8220;we have not attempted to counter any of Russia’s moves in Ukraine or Syria.&#8221; You want to counter Russian fight against ISIS in Syria and counter Russian help to civils to protect themselves against bombs from new illegal Ukrainian government, supported by US?<br/>
Read your comment carefully and you will probably understand what is going on in the World. Why US initiated the war in Syria, Why US supported the coup in Ukraine? But you are thinking about Russian attempts to stop the war – what a crime! </p>

<p>Thank you. You and your organization have done America a great service. That is unless the idiots don&#8217;t recognize a traitor when she blind sides them hits them in the face. Maybe we can set up security at the polls and have the ones voting for her dragged off with her and she can rule her flock from inside Guantanamo Bay for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>Whether you are pro hacking or not pro hacking and whether it is WikiLeaks or not WikiLeaks, once Pandora&#8217;s Box is open it can&#8217;t be closed. Whether it is right or wrong to hack into emails is no longer the issue once the emails are being posted. I am so tired of people getting around the question of subject matter by bringing up the argument that they shouldn&#8217;t be hacked and how terrible it is that they were. That doesn&#8217;t answer the question they were asked. It&#8217;s avoidance in it&#8217;s worst form and it makes me sick. Do I condone the actions of those who are breaking the laws and doing the hacking? No, I do not. Do I think that those exposed need to answer the questions asked about the information that was produced from the illegal act? Yes, I do.</p>

<p>There is not one mention of this Wikileak article in network news. More evidence that the &#8220;press&#8221; is part of the Democrat machine. At least Izvestia was openly labeled as a state news source. Our press persists in claiming to be unbiased and nothing could be further than the truth.</p>

<p>I see suggestions in this thread that Assange is pro-Trump since he has not released any damning e-mails from Donald. Looking at Assange&#8217;s history, I doubt he really has a high opinion of Trump. It could be that Trump communicates with something other than a home brew server with no more security than any common PC in Joe Averages home, and possible less. Trump has enough forethought and acumen to use high quality firewalls and encryption. Not g-mail. If Assange had any dirt on Trump he would use it to foment a complete collapse of the election, not just one candidate. Then again, he might still&#8230;</p>

<p>Trump personally doesn&#8217;t use email as habit (know fact) Assange releases / reveals only what he has been given. He has said that he has a little from the RNC, it however has nothing more incriminating than Trumps own verbal comments already on display. Trump speaks exactly whats on his mind and at the time he thinks it. He is honest. He has no reason to hide shady government actions and he has Not been a part of the government in which data has been collected</p>

<p>I have no respect for Julian Assange. The man belongs in jail for molestation. His release of other people&#8217;s emails is on purpose to detract from his crimes and enable sympathy to avoid prosecution. If he is really concerned about justice and uncovering material and decisions deemed illegal he would ALSO be releasing information about Donald Trump&#8217;s illegal activities. But because he won&#8217;t do that, this is clearly a political agenda.</p>

<p>Your comment has been mostly devoid of rational analysis based on data, context and metrics. No references at all. Your comment kinda reminds me of one of the best graffiti I&#8217;ve seen.

<p>So what you are trying to say is Hillary still has your vote as she is innocent and it&#8217;s the bearer of the news that is at fault. That is down right pathetic. No, that&#8217;s down right treasonous because stupid can no longer be used as an excuse.</p>

<p>Why do so many gullible people still think that Julian Assange is guilty of rape? If you don’t know that it is a concocted allegation by the FBI to try and stop him from sharing the truth and embarrassing poor political buddies, then I guess you deserve to vote ‘hillary’ and believe all her stupid deceptions, and then live with the consequences. Best of luck to you.<br/>
Also, Julian is not trying to sway the US election, but merely trying to expose corruption and those who put him in his predicament, jail in the embassy for so long. I hope he gets every one of them. One gets used to corruption when it comes to pure money, but when it puts people in jail for their own causes, then these people deserve to rot.</p>

<p>Maybe before you do any reporting you should read the Deceleration of Independence and find out what is not only his right but duty.. The only ill effect I think we would see if we all did our duty is a shortage of hemp rope and strong limb trees. A shortage I would be more than willing to live with.</p>

<p>I absolutely support Wikileaks revealing Hillary&#8217;s crimes. Someone has to because the FBI and the DOJ are too politicized to do it. Why would the DOJ give immunity to a person that is a subject of the investigation &#8211; Cheryl Mills</p>

<p>Albert Fall, Prez Harding&#8217;s Sec of the Interior went to prison over accepting bribes. Hillary &amp; Bill&#8217;s speaking fees are basically bribes and lets not forget about the Haiti grants/domations which only became 6 houses in Haiti. These two criminals have skirted justice too long.</p>
<p>Fall, following a lengthy Senate investigation, was tried for accepting bribes. He was convicted and sent to federal prison, the first Cabinet-level officer in American history to go to jail for crimes committed while serving in office. Hillary should follow to prison following her criminal activities of selling influence to people and countries while she was Sec. of State.</p>

<p>I am sure that when Billy met with the attorney general for thirty minutes and just discussed their grangchildren. The conversation may have gone like this: Billy I love my grandchildren just like you love yours and it would be tragic if something like an accident were to happen don&#8217;t you agree?? She said oh my I would be devastated. Billy said that what James said.</p>

<p>Julian Assange has done what other people have only tried to do for years. During the Nixon Presidency, the CIA &#8220;broke into&#8221; the DNH, to collect information on the illegally operating system there quietly. Nixon was thrown under the Bus by everyone, in what would eventually be called watergate, and the Democrats continued with illegal activity for years until Julian came along, and proved what the CIA under the Nixon Administration was trying to prove all along. So now, because the records are stored on a computer, instead of in a filing cabinet, it is good to have the truth about the DNC released. Picture how the release of the criminal activity within the Democrats party would have changed the history of our country had it been released in the 70&#8217;s instead of now. People would have known better than to elect Slick Willie, You wouldn&#8217;t know Who Monika was, the Clintons would have spent the last 30 odd years behind bars of a different kind than they are used to. Likely we would still be number 1 in many areas we were number 1 in before, and the Dems have made us fall behind in, in order to try to hold power over a helpless nation. We could be #1 in the world still today, but instead we look at that as a negative time in our history, instead of a time when the government actually reached out to show people the criminal activity within the DNC.</p>

<p>I support Julian Assange, people should be aware of what their government is capable of doing.Hillary supporters don&#8217;t care about the death and destruction her and Obama have caused as long as it doesn&#8217;t effect their daily lives. They will decry what is happening in the middle east not interested that their own government created it. They care not that those seals were told to stand down while four men lost their lives in Benghazi. Through history it has usually been men who were the war mongers, Hillary brings new meaning to the term cold and calculating. She reminds me of the double agent Mata Hari, only she did this with her governments approval and you can be sure she didn&#8217;t act alone.</p>

<p>Hilary Clinton only server a few days into Obama&#8217;s second term while John Kerry was being approved by congress. It was also right after her concussion problems which the alt right has pointed out countless time that it has weakened her and she no longer has the stamina. So does Clinton have the stamina in 7 days to fully arm ISIS or is she so sickly that she is near death. Please pick only one conspiracy because two contradict themselves.</p>

<p>If you didn&#8217;t know this before you should be ashamed of yourself. It has been common knowledge outside the United States for over two years. Through our State Department we have been funding and supplying DAESH/ISIS from the beginning and many of their leaders were trained in the U.S. Quit relying on the dis-information provided by American media. They work for the government, (Or actually Soros and his buddies), and are there to provide a smoke screen for what our government is doing to protect them from the citizens. Nothing more.</p>

<p>William almost has it right. Obamas &#8220;support&#8221; for Hillary is really support for Abedin and the Muslim Brotherhood. You will watch Obama direct huge long term military contracts to ISIS linked small businesses in his final days.<br/>
Once you let someone get away with Treason&#8230;&#8230;they do it again and again. Treason is profitable</p>

<p>Obama and Hillary first supported the ousting of Mubarak in Egypt and then pushed for the seating of Mohamed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, as president. Although the mainstream media says he was the first democratically elected president in Egypt I know for a fact vote rigging and other underhanded acts were committed to put him in office. Once he was in Obama and HIllary pumped billions into Egypt which was used to fund Hamas, Hezbollah and Al Qaeda. Morsi was willing to give part of the Sinai to Hamas and part of the southern Egyptian area to Sudan. Under Morsi the Muslim Brotherhood funneled arms and money to terrorist elements in the Sinai. It&#8217;s those terrorists that President Sisi is now having to deal with. The Brotherhood wreaked havoc in Egypt after Morsi was jailed. They burned churches, mosques and government buildings. They&#8217;ve killed police and Christians. America is no longer considered a friendly partner in Egypt and this will not change until Obama is out of office. If Hillary is elected there will be no change. She was on the side of the Brotherhood and Qatar. Under her time as Sec. of State she had every intention of cutting up Egypt and diminishing its power as the center of influence in the Middle East.</p>

<p>come on your post is just muslimphobia and you must be in the basket of undesirables because that is what Hillary is saying, reminding me of the joke about the woman speaking with the guy, he says he hates gays and lesbians and thinks women belong in the home, the woman calls him a hate filled republican, He says I am not I am a muslim and those are my beliefs, now she says I udnerstand, forgive me I dont&#8217; want to be an islamophobe.</p>
<p>Seems the only people that can&#8217;t connect the dots are Liberals, dems, media and grubers that make up the democrat party</p>

<p>How long before Obama is behind bars&#8230;he is directly responsible for all of her irresponsibility as he is the one who put her in his administration. How could he is my question. Yes he is guilty, but he is more guilty for not doing HIS job of overseeing her activities and putting her in office period. I do not think she should override the crimes of Obama or cause us to lose focus on the biggest problem of all&#8230;.Obama and his crimes make Hillary look like a school girl even though they are horrific!</p>

<p>James Comey actually set up the prosecutorial path. He set it up with indicting Hillary without indicting Hillary. He left room for plenty of others to dig around and find, at the same time recusing himself as most likely &#8220;the fix&#8221; was pressuring him and most likely he was blackmailed. As he than said that &#8220;no reasonable prosecutor would take this case&#8221; this is a ridiculous statement. The evidence is surmountable if a few leaves where turned.</p>

<p>While I indeed support Wikileaks and the admirable work being done by J. Assange, it is sad to see there are so many Bubble People that still actually support Hillary. My background and knowledge about HRC does not come from so called right wing idols or propagandists but knowledge of how the Clintons operated in Arkansas. Their efficient brutality intimidated most, especially the media. As I was in the media I heard more than one confession about a story that involved death, chaos and destruction and those in Little Rock informed me they weren&#8217;t going to go there. Those who are gulliable enough to be influenced by the propaganda most of the MSM puts out are indeed part of the mindless lowly informed voter group or just plain mesmerized by the Clintons. Those who cry conspiracy theories about HRC still believe that labelling will mask the facts that are out there. Whistleblowers, women who are living with memories of assaults by Slick Willy, A state agency in Arkansas set up to launder drug money and incur favor from incoming businesses. Not to mention HRC&#8217;s involvement in Benghazi and her elaborate set up to supply what has been called the Syrian Free Army (initially, they were actually paid mercenaries, and recruited from that base of folks) and those who supported the anti-Qhadaffi group. They all were involved with Al-Qaeda. There is proof but those on the left with the blinders on will never see it. Hope we get a little more light in November. America does not need another president pushing for globalization and the elimination of our personal individual rights again.</p>

<p>Anybody heard of the Clinton Scandal Paradox, for lack of a better word? It&#8217;s a form of cognitive dissonance that infects many Bubble People. Let me explain it.<br/>
There is a small minority of gullible nonthinkers and confused conspiracy theorists who believe that Hillary Clinton is guilty of some ethereal set of crimes or unethical behavior. They are unable to articulate what the crimes are because they only exist in a muddled state of chaos in their confused imaginations. They were implanted by right-wing propagandists and their media accomplices. I realize that, to confused conservatives, nothing needs to make sense, logic is turned upside down, common sense is the first thing thrown out the window, and trying to reconcile actual facts with the confusion that they live with on a daily basis is not exactly a priority.<br/>
Here&#8217;s a CHALLENGE. How do you nonthinkers rationalize the fact that there is not now, and never has been, any proof that Hillary Clinton is guilty of any of the crimes and unethical behavior that YOU have allowed yourselves to be brainwashed into believing by your idiotic right-wing idols?<br/>
Don’t be mindless sheep and go rebleating the right wing lies and disinformation that you have been brainwashed to believe. They are NOT PROOF!!!!! I ask for PROOF, not the lies and disinformation, itself.</p>

<p>You are so in love with yourself. I am sure your proud because you can throw baseless insults and pat yourself on the back. Oh please do not bruise yourself in the process. With your world white is black. North is South. East is West and stupidity is brilliance. This is my take on you. Am I correct on my assumption? Now can you argue an intellectual premise to change my mind? Rule 1 do not use baseless insults, if you do automatically disqualified. Make me agree with you using facts. My challenge is I can successfully prosecute Hillary on what evidence I have now. Now successfully defend her against what I bring. Lets have fun with this one. I am confident.</p>

<p>Do I support Wikkileaks disclosing this information. Yes, of course. Better than voting for someone because she is a &#8220;woman&#8221;. Maybe he&#8217;ll even find an e-mail that shows she&#8217;s not even that.</p>

<p>&#8220;WE THE PEOPLE&#8221; need to start making some noise about how Killary is being protected&#8211;they all know she committed perjury&#8211;they all know she and Obozo armed ISIS&#8211;Rand Paul knew it when he questioned her in the Benghazi hearing but he didn&#8217;t pursue it&#8211;WHY?<br/>
Stevens and Smith were in that house &#8211;that wasn&#8217;t even a consulate&#8211;without proper security&#8211;because&#8211;he and about 30 CIA personal were loading Qaddafi stolen weapons onto ship that went along the Med. Sea to where Turkey and Syria meet&#8211;then the weapons went down into Syria for ISIS&#8212;so in essence they were arming ISIS&#8211;they didn&#8217;t have proper security because it was a COVERT OPERATION&#8211;you don&#8217;t have our military protect a COVERT OP as then it wouldn&#8217;t be COVERT! Killary and Obozo need to be brought to trial for treason&#8211;and please&#8211;Wikileaks&#8212;<br/>
please hurry this up!!!</p>

<p>Assange hates America. He is in Putin&#8217;s back pocket, which is why he favors Trump. He expects Trump to allow him to travel the US without threat of extradition. Trump is beholden to Putin because of all the money he owes Putin&#8217;s Russian oligarch buddies. Putin knows Trump will let him do anything he wants on the global stage. This stinks more than any Clinton scandal</p>

<p>I am convinced that there is a goal for our endorsement of these terrorist Muslim groups over the past decade. It must be a strategy to<br/>
1) keep our citizens from having to physically fight the wars.<br/>
2) create such hostile environmentso within country borders that the citizens move across country borders (Europe 2016) with the goal of these immigrants being to change the makeup and politics of their host countries.<br/>
3) to ultimately force the creation of a NWO by necessity. Causing citizens to beg for martial law and delivering absolute power to the perpetrators of the entire charade.<br/>
4) there&#8217;s more I can&#8217;t imagine but here&#8217;s a start on my theories.</p>

<p>Stevens and Smith were in that house &#8211;that wasn&#8217;t even a consulate&#8211;without proper security&#8211;because&#8211;he and about 30 CIA personal were loading Qaddafi stolen weapons onto ship that went along the Med. Sea to where Turkey and Syria meet&#8211;then the weapons went down into Syria for ISIS&#8212;so in essence they were arming ISIS&#8211;they didn&#8217;t have proper security because it was a COVERT OPERATION&#8211;you don&#8217;t have our military protect a COVERT OP as then it wouldn&#8217;t be COVERT!</p>

<p>Assange needs to release these e-mails immediately. There has already been at least one attempt on his life, and I&#8217;ve seen that Clinton is putting pressure on the Embassy to stop allowing him protection in their facility. This woman has no morals, feels she is above the law, and will do anything to protect the power she hopes to grab, if elected president. She has made ridiculous comments, as in the reason for her coughing fit at a rally lately, being due to an allergy to thinking about Trump. Democrats are idiots to even consider this charlatan to head our country. WHAT ARE YOU MORONS THINKING?</p>

<p>Analytical minds that have followed closely every move O has made knew this. Hamas leader said this. It is a fact. In fact Rand Paul spoke of the arms when this happened. Why would an American president and Secretary of State do this to someone who was no imminent threat to us or anyone? In fact it is pathetic to read his son&#8217;s replies and begging for O not to kill his father. Gaddafi couldn&#8217;t figure out why O turned on him. He had called him a Native son. Yeh well he learned what side that Native son was on. </p>
<p>What kind of American president and Secretary of State encourage Egypt to elect Muslim Brotherhood Morsi?. Traitors that is who.</p>
<p>Go Assange but you best to put it on billboards across this country cause the witch won&#8217;t go down long as O in office.</p>

<p>With All These Crimes Hillary Has Committed Why Isn&#8217;t She In Jail Is The Question On A Lot Of Lips. Could It Be Their Waiting For Obama To Get Out Of Office So She Won&#8217;t Be Pardoned?

<p>They have to bring her down on more than just lying under oath. That&#8217;ll be a slap on the hand vs. all of the other crimes she&#8217;s known to have committed or has been linked to. But for now, the US has to keep her out of the White House. Oh, and I&#8217;m not a Right Wing Lunatic. I&#8217;m an independent US citizen that actually reads the news and doesn&#8217;t feast on CNN/MSNBC/FOX.</p>

<p>For Mary &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. Isn`t it odd that you would want something fact checked by the media when it is telling the truth about a liberal socialist democrat ; but you and yours` freely accept anything and everything that the liberal socialist democrat bias` media says about a Republican , Conservative , ; or a Christian without any thought of fact checking ? BYW ; Did you fact check this story when it was told by Hillary Clinton ? Nope , you and your kind believed every word without a thought of fact checking !!!

<p>Are you seriously posting something Assange says before you fact check it? That&#8217;s not journalism. It&#8217;s gossip. And it&#8217;s damaging to our national conversation. Look how many people in the comments take this as the truth without any question whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mary ~ How is a person supposed to &#8216;fact-check&#8217; information such as this, when the majority of our current administration AND CONGRESS are corrupted, covering up these illegal actions? Do you seriously think they&#8217;re going to say &#8220;OK, you caught us! Let us clear out our desks and office! We&#8217;ll report to the local police station on Monday!&#8221;&#8230;.???? Are you so naïve, that you believe Obama and Hillary did this all by themselves? Corruption in our government is found ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISLE! With the majority of our government in bed with these criminals!! There are only a handful of people that have shown to be even remotely &#8221;honest&#8221; in our current government. Trey Goudy is one of the few, for he believes in following the Constitution, supporting it and how our government was/is supposed to be administered! He has been doing his best to hold EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE, for their illegal actions. However, he&#8217;s been lied to, by those in collusion of corruption, that is so rampant, it&#8217;s systemic!! NO ONE is going to admit the truths, for they will go down too! Seriously, what you&#8217;re proposing is like asking the successful bank robber(s) to turn himself/themselves in and admit their crimes&#8230;.Never going to happen! Here&#8217;s a question for you&#8230;..Why would a man go out on a limb, so far as to force him into exile, where he&#8217;s had to live the last 5+ years within an embassy building? Where he doesn&#8217;t dare go outside, for fear of being killed, or taken into custody, where he&#8217;ll eventually be put away, or 6 feet under!&#8230;..Why would a person risk their life, if it wasn&#8217;t to expose the REAL TRUTHS??? Those &#8216;TRUTHS&#8217; which the perpetrators/criminals will do absolutely anything to keep them hidden!<br/>
I bet you&#8217;re one of those whom deny that the new world order doesn&#8217;t exist&#8230;.Right? Well, here&#8217;s a news flash&#8230;..They&#8217;re real, it exists, they are the globalists, and the UN is their one world government! They now make the laws for the world to follow. Anyone (countries, or people) whom oppose them&#8230;.Find their countries being attacked, or the person ends up in prison or dead!<br/>
But, don&#8217;t take my word about it&#8230;.Hear the globalists themselves admit to the existence of the &#8216;new world order&#8217;! It&#8217;s no longer conspiracy theory! George H. W. Bush, Henry Kissinger, Joe Biden, Micheil Saakasjvili, Bill Clinton, Strobe Talbot, Richard Nixon, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Ricardo Lagos, BARRACK OBAMA, Al Gore, Stephen Harper, John Kerry, David Gergen, Paul Martin, David Rockefellar, George Soros, Jacob Rothschild, ALL SPEAK OF AND REFER TO IT! Hear it from their own mouths at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c9PMV3ZJg" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c9PMV3ZJg</a><br/>
Do you remember Obama saying that America MUST GIVE UP SOME OF IT&#8221;S SOVEREIGNTY, to a higher power&#8230;That being the UN? So that America can become a part of the global world. That global world is the new world order!<br/>
Even the POPE is part of this order. Do you remember his speeches, when he came to the US last year? In which he said &#8220;The American people MUST ACCEPT less in jobs, housing, and land use!&#8221; &#8230;.&#8221;They MUST ALSO ACCEPT selfless servitude to others!&#8221; Then when he addressed the UN meeting in New York, he said to the world leaders there &#8220;You must accept, adopt, and sign onto the UN&#8217;s 2030 Agenda document. Then you must take those mandates of the UN&#8217;s uncontestable laws for the world, and implement them into your governance of your people!&#8221; But, again don&#8217;t take my word for it&#8230;.Look up his speeches and watch them in their entirety. Then let that sink in! After which, ask yourself why a sovereign nation, America, or any other sovereign nation, should allow a foreign entity to dictate to them what they can. or cannot do! Research what countries are members of the UN. Notice that those that are not members, all have had foreign forces invade them, for some reason or another! With the exception of North Korea and Russia!<br/>
Then research the UN&#8217;s policy on their initiative of &#8216;GLOBAL DECOLONIZATION&#8217;. They&#8217;re decolonizing the world! The UN mandates that no country can deny &#8216;free migration&#8217; of the world&#8217;s people. That&#8217;s the real reason why our American government won&#8217;t enforce our immigration laws, or why it supports sanctuary cities/strong cities, etc.<br/>
Do you not realize that our forefathers didn&#8217;t have a revolution, to free this nation from foreign control, to give it&#8217;s CITIZENS FREEDOM TO CHOOSE AND DICTATE THEIR OWN WAY OF LIFE AND GOVERNANCE, to have it&#8217;s sovereignty be given back to a foreign government entity!! The USA can retain it&#8217;s sovereignty, and still be a part of the global market&#8230;..Or, it should be allowed to! But, instead, over the last century our government has been in collusion to give up America&#8217;s sovereignty, and have it allow a foreign entity (the UN) to dictate it&#8217;s laws and policies, even when they are in DIRECT CONFLICT OF OUR CONSTITUTION!!! Their power in our government has now become overwhelmingly powerful, and if the American people don&#8217;t give up some of our sovereignty, taking it&#8217;s orders from the UN, then the UN will send in their international security forces and make us! There are a majority of those in our government that will help them to do this. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re facing in all this!<br/>
I have another question for you&#8230;Do you like working your butt off, to afford to take care of yourself and family, to have our government say that you MUST also give more taxes than we already do, to help pay for another&#8217;s keep? Because basically that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening now. Our taxes go up, costs of merchandise, food, healthcare, home costs, EVERYTHING, has gone up! They claim higher prices are due to raising costs associated with manufacturing the products etc. Yet, many manufacturers are taking their manufacturing over to other countries, because it&#8217;s cheaper to make them there&#8230;.right? So, if they&#8217;re making them cheaper&#8230;Why are costs going up? It&#8217;s because when you pay for something, you&#8217;re paying for someone else, probably in another country, or someone else here in America, to get it too (socialism instead of independence and self responsibility/accountability)&#8230;.But, they can&#8217;t afford to pay for it, for some reason or another! Where do you think our government comes up with the monies they give to the UN, or other countries, etc.? What we pay in income taxes doesn&#8217;t cover all the monies going out. It&#8217;s one thing to want to donate willingly, to the needy. But, to force your family to have to pay for other&#8217;s shortcomings, by taking from what you earned for your family&#8217;s needs is another! Why is our government taking the citizen&#8217;s monies (taxes, etc) and giving it to people that are NOT CITIZENS, or another country, where their governments are putting most of the funds into their own pockets, and not much is really going to the people that need it? Instead of our own government taking care of it&#8217;s own citizens, it&#8217;s giving our money away, while our own citizens suffer! It&#8217;s forced socialism&#8230;.and THAT&#8217;S JUST PLAIN NOT RIGHT!<br/>
Do you know what the Bilderberg Group is? It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s wealthy, that get together every year, and they decide what they&#8217;ll do for the next year&#8230;.Planning what they will allow to happen, for everyone else! They plot how they will continue to keep the average person busy, by them trying to make ends meet and afford to take care of and feed their families, so the average person doesn&#8217;t have time to investigate what and whom they are&#8230;..All the while they&#8217;re determining what the world&#8217;s people are allowed to have, or do! They find ways to get more money out of the common person, one way or another, to help fund their one world order plan.<br/>
SO MARY&#8230;.HOW ARE WE TRULY SUPPOSED TO VERIFY ASSANGE&#8217;S EVIDENCE, WHEN THE GLOBAL ELITISTS WILL DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT THEIR POWER AND PLAYERS?? WHY WOULD ASSANGE PUT HIMSELF IN DANGER AND EXILE OF A FOREIGN EMBASSY, TO TRY AND GET THE TRUTH OUT TO THE PEOPLE, IF IT WASN&#8217;T TRUTHS?? Could it be that he doesn&#8217;t want to live under tyranny, or forced global socialism, and he&#8217;s trying to wake the people up, before it&#8217;s too late? Of course the global elitists want to smear his &#8216;reputation&#8217; and hope the people won&#8217;t listen to him, or become wise to their plans for the world&#8217;s people!<br/>
Another question&#8230;.Does our Constitution not state that a person must be a legal US CITIZEN to be able to vote in our elections? When we have a massive amount of illegals in this country, or people here on work visas, but are NOT a legal citizen, WHY WOULDN&#8217;T OUR GOVERNMENT WANT TO ENSURE THAT ONLY LEGAL CITIZENS ARE ALLOWED TO VOTE? Do you honestly believe that those here illegally, or whom are NOT legal citizens, will obey the law and not vote, simply because they&#8217;re honest and will abide by the &#8216;honor system&#8217;? Or, if our government won&#8217;t put in some sort of system to protect against illegal voting, that those illegal voters won&#8217;t try to vote and vote for those whom promise to give themselves legality to remain here, with social benefits, at the cost of legal citizens? We are currently facing global socialism vs legal citizen&#8217;s sovereignty and rights! Obama WAS NOT JOKING when he said the end of the Republic never looked so good, at the correspondent&#8217;s dinner! This election will be the determining factor of whether our country retains it&#8217;s sovereignty as a Republic, or becomes under rule of the UN&#8217;s global uncontestable laws, with our Constitution and it&#8217;s laws replaced&#8230;.No longer a sovereign Republic!</p>

<p>Denial is a wonderful thing. Keep doing it, it could work. She could get by with all of these criminal acts, as long as people like yourself keep denying what happened. As far as the journalism side, I somewhat agree, but it is impossible to find any news source, including the main stream media, and Hillary Crowner&#8230;PBS, that is trustworthy or follows journalistic practices what so ever.</p>

<p>TWILA~ News Flash&#8230;..The corruption is rampant on BOTH SIDES OF THE ISLE! Both sides are playing their part in a play, pointing at one another, blaming the other for the corruption, making the normal citizen think they have any say in what our government does, or does not do! Our government takes it&#8217;s orders from the UN&#8230;.Not the American citizens, or our Constitution! This corruption has been going on for years, decades for that matter! They play both sides against the middle, while they do as they&#8217;re told by the UN&#8230;.Our one world government now! The UN mandates global UNCONTESTABLE LAWS FOR THE WORLD NOW, and our government is following those orders! Even though many are in direct conflict of our US Constitution. Even our SCOTUS takes it&#8217;s orders from the UN, telling the people that things are constitutional, when they are not! Wake up! America no longer is a sovereign Republic&#8230;.We&#8217;re just a member state of the global government of the UN!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;At some point there’s going to be a terrorist diaspora out of Syria like we’ve never seen before&#8217;, [FBI Director] Comey said Wednesday in New York.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Just ask, Who were the instigators of the Syrian genocide? It should be obvious to anyone who pays it attention and thought that the Syrian “rebels,” with their extensive supplies of weaponry, such as anti-tank missiles, and a complete command structure, had state supporters. The state supporters include NATO members, U.S., Britain, and Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. The plan was to topple Arab dictators in the Arab Spring, including Libya, Egypt and then Syria. Hillary identified herself as the she liberator of Libya when she said of Gaddafi, “We came, we saw, he died.” The Benghazi episode was about weapons trafficking of the Libyan military arsenal through Turkey into Syria, with the eventual help of Egypt&#8217;s replacement leader, the Muslim Brotherhood&#8217;s Morsi.   What was the U.S. role? </p>
<p>Sibel Edmonds says the U.S. was the director and producer of the play. Remember Obama and NATO member Britain overthrew Gaddafi, and Obama wouldn&#8217;t wait for the scheduled elections in Egypt. He insisted Mubarak step down immediately and elections immediately, with the expected result that the Muslim Brotherhood&#8217;s Morsi would win election. When Obama spoke in Cairo, he had insisted that members of the Muslim Brotherhood, outlawed in Egypt after the assassination of Anwar Sadat, be given front row seats. There he identified himself as a Christian, yet included a curious parenthetical in his description of the story of Isra: “when Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed (peace be upon them) joined in prayer,” and referred to America as having a partnership with Islam (not Egypt). And at the UN Obama said, &#8220;The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.&#8221; </p>
<p>  The Obama administration admitted in congressional testimony that it funneled over 600 tons of weapons to Islamist fighters in Syria. From one article (WSJ): “The utter failure of Western policy in both Libya and Syria has to be seen for what it is: not just a political blunder but a humanitarian crime.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrEPadG0pQk</p>

<p>And, yes, we have supplied ISIS with equipment and other aid, as has the Saudis, the Qataris and other countries. This is the reason Bernie Sanders said that those countries should take a lead in fighting against ISIS and ours should be a minimal participation!</p>

<p>I can believe Israel wants Syria gone, just like they want the Pakistanis gone. Not really sure why US politicians have their heads buried in the rectum of Israel, maybe because if the don&#8217;t obey, US financial collapse will occur. Even Stephen Hawking wants Israel boycotted, due to their cruel people.</p>

<p>HOW MANY HEALTHY YOUNG,MEN AND WOMEN HAVE TO DIE AT THE BLOODY HANDS OF THE CLINTON CARTEL? THEY DIED GETTING THE TRUTH TO AMERICANS! SHAME.<br/>
On July 3, 2016, Shawn Lucas and filmmaker Ricardo Villaba served the DNC Services Corp. and Chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz at DNC’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., in the fraud class action suit against the Democrat Party on behalf of Bernie Sanders supporters.<br/>
Shawn Lucas was thrilled about serving the papers to the DNC before Independence Day.<br/>
** This was before Wikileaks released documents proving the DNC was working against the Sanders campaign during the 2016 primary.<br/>
Shawn Lucas was found dead this week.<br/>
We contacted Lucas’ employer on 4 August 2016 to ask whether there was any truth to the rumor. According to an individual with whom we spoke at that company, Shawn Lucas died on 2 August 2016. The audibly and understandably shaken employee stated that interest in the circumstances of Lucas’ death had prompted a number of phone calls and other queries, but the company had not yet ascertained any details about Lucas’ cause of death and were unable to confirm anything more than the fact he had passed away.<br/>
An unconfirmed report holds that Lucas was found lying on the bathroom floor by his girlfriend when she returned home on the evening of 2 August 2016. Paramedics responding to her 911 call found no signs of life.<br/>
This follows the death of 27 year-old Democratic staffer Seth Conrad Rich who was murdered in Washington DC on July 8. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone. Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a “lead” saying that Rich was en route to the FBI the morning of his murder, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an “ongoing court case” possibly involving the Clinton family.<br/>
And on June 22, 2016, former UN official John Ashe “accidentally” crushed his own throat and died a week before he was scheduled to testify against the Clintons and Democrat Party.</p>

<p>The attack on Libya was completely unnecessary as Gaddafi was helping us against the Muslim Brotherhood but I guess that&#8217;s why Obutthead felt the need to take him out. Obutthead has intervened in several cases going against our supporters in favor of the terrorists. Look at Egypt, they were a pro-US government until Obutthead came in and urged the Muslim Brotherhood to rebel. Obama wants to destroy our friends and join our enemies. Look how he&#8217;s been kissing the feet of the Iranians the number one state sponsor of terror around the world.</p>

<p>I wish WikiLeaks would come on and release the e-mails they have against Hillary Clinton and show the world that there is no denying that she is a criminal and cannot be trusted to tell the truth, handle classified information that keeps America safe and shows the many crooked deals she has worked for personal gain and interest. However, I believe the supporters of Hillary Clinton know she is a lying crook but for their personal gain do not care and will vote for her anyway. Our only salvation to keep the Democrats from stealing another election is to get her arrested before Novembers election. Especially since the stupid judges passed the law that a picture I D is not needed to vote. Hell, we&#8217;ll have terrorists voting, dead people, illegal aliens, and others multiple times. A lot of poor blacks fish. They need a license or state ID to get fishing license and they do it so what&#8217;s the big deal. Crooks that what Democrats are.</p>

<p>And don&#8217;t forget Barack Hussein Obama role in all of this!!!!! after&#8211;or while&#8211;weapons were being given/sold to ISIS he ordered the withdrawl of all U.S. troops from the area SO ISIS COULD FLOURISH!!! If he&#8217;d left some troops there ISIS wouldn&#8217;t have gotten a foothold! These two have cause a great deal of damage&#8211;they created the refugee crisis that flooded Europe with millions of mainly young fighting age males&#8211;who should have stayed and fought! How Europe is going to manage to deport ALL OF THE REFUGEES the question&#8211;they probably won&#8217;t as some won&#8217;t go of course and stay behind to become *lone wolves*! THIS WAS ALL PLANNED BY OBOZO AND KILLARY AND THEY BOTH NEED TO BE ARRESTED AND TRIED FOR TREASON!!!</p>

<p>It is truly inexplicable and shocking that SO MUCH is known about the clintons &#8212; be it murders, drug running, vast corruption, money laundering on an epic scale, sexual perversions (both of them), lies, whoring themselves to any entity without regard to ethics or consequences, causing death and destruction around the Middle East and MORE &#8211; yet there is a core of DEMS who are so blatantly ignorant and in denial they continue to extol her &#8216;virtues&#8217; with pride and passion! Surely the DEMS must be handing out some sort of mind altering drugs at all their rallies to foster such vast denial! It used to be all Bush&#8217;s fault, now it is all Trump&#8217;s fault &#8211; while most sane people can SEE it starts and ends with the clintons and obama! There are many oddities and pathetic things happening in this once great nation, but nothing compares to the support given to hillary, EXCEPT THAT SHE AND BUBBA REMAIN OUT OF PRISON STILL!</p>

<p>Karen: I have faith in the American people, you can see it in the pictures of both rallies Trump has thousands and thousands of people that most cannot even enter while on the other hand Clinton can&#8217;t even fill a high school gym. Trump is fighting two fronts the deceitful media and the Clinton machine and neither are going to win in he end.</p>

<p>Trump has balls. Our government and everyone in it is corrupt and he is the only one with balls enough to out everyone. The media is corrupt and its time we boycott the left wing media completely and drive them out of business. This country is a hotbed of corruption from the local cop to the frigging President. Everyone needs an accountability check and civilian overseer&#8217;s to make sure everyone is playing straight.</p>

<p>Hillary is not doomed. I believe network news could interview her as she eats aborted fetuses for breakfast, and the Democrats would rally around her and vote for her anyway. The media would also try to find a way to implicate Trump for the incident.</p>

<p>The way to understand Benghazi is to think of it in religious terms and not political terms. Then ask yourself &#8211; Why was the ambassador to Libya at a remote consulate rather than the embassy in Tripoli on 9/11? Was he set up by obama and hillary as a sacrifice to the muslims to atone for the killing of osama? Atonement is the killing of the innocent to appease allah and the muslims. Stevens was an innocent Christian with no blood on his hands. How many more such sacrifices will we see? The irony and the symbolism is that the ambassador&#8217;s first name was Christopher &#8211; which means a bearer of Christ. The killing of the ambassador was done on 9/11. It was pre-planned. He had no security. The Seals that were with him were not assigned but volunteered. He feared for his life all along. He was clearly ordered to go to Benghazi which was an unprotected consulate. The weapons used were supplied by obama. The killing was a pagan ritual killing no doubt overseen by an imam and observed via remote by obama and hillary. This explains their absence from the public view. It was done to atone for the killing of osama by obama. Symbolism is important to the low IQ and big ego muslims and this killing was full of symbolism including the name of the ambassador. When the protesters were screaming &#8220;obama, obama we are all osama&#8217;s now&#8221; &#8211; that meant that obama&#8217;s atonement for the killing of osama was accepted by the muslims. They now know that obama is once again one of them. This was the signal that ISIS needed to march and that is what they did with the blessings of obama and hillary. We are dealing with primitive savages and obama as well as hillary are one with them.</p>

<p>Nick- You said, &#8221; &#8220;Was he set up by obama and hillary as a sacrifice to the muslims to atone for the killing of osama? Atonement is the killing of the innocent to appease allah and the muslims. Stevens was an innocent Christian with no blood on his hands &#8230; The irony and the symbolism is that the ambassador’s first name was Christopher – which means a bearer of Christ. The killing of the ambassador was done on 9/11. It was pre-planned. He had no security. The Seals that were with him were not assigned but volunteered.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Hebrew-Aramaic name for &#8220;Jesus&#8221; was yeshu‘a which is short for yehōshu‘a ,or Joshua &#8230; Kinda like Will being short for William. That name is why many Jews at the time thought he was the foretold Messiah, even though Yesh&#8217;u was not the fierce military leader and warrior that they expected.They had thought that yehōshu‘a (Joshua) would be reborn and as I said, the name was very close. So, it went from yeshu&#8217;a, short for yehōshu‘a in Hebrew-Aramaic. The authors of the Septuagint changed that into the Greek name Іησους -Iēsous and did so because a few of the sounds of Jesus&#8217;s name in Hebrew had no complementary sounds in Greek, the &#8220;sh&#8221; as in sharp and the &#8220;y&#8221; as in yet. Also, Greek masculine names never ended in vowel sounds (look up transliteration)</p>
<p>The Latin Vulgate transliterated the already massacred name of Yeshu&#8217;a but since all the sounds in the name were also made in Latin, and the letters of the Latin alphabet are different from Greek but very close to English. So, in Latin. the name became lesus. From there, it became Jesus, and remember, until the 12th or so century, there was no &#8220;J&#8221; in English ( and never in Hebrew, Greek, Latin or Aramaic)</p>
<p>The term Christ is not a name, but a title, and a title that does NOT mean what you think it means. It is the Greek terms for &#8220;Χριστός&#8221; (pronounced &#8220;khristós&#8221;) and from the Hebrew word &#8220;מָשִׁיחַ&#8221; (pronounced &#8220;mashíach&#8221;) or Messiah. Problem with this is that the ritual of anointing political figures and religious leaders was very common in the Near East (and hey, that includes ancient Palestine) Every damn king and almost all priest (The brother of Moses, Aaron,too) were anointed and called &#8220;Messiah.&#8221; All the anointed had some VIP rights that went with that &#8212;one which included not being able to do any violence or bodily harm to any anointed as you would be doing harm to god by proxy, the Messiahs. It was a akin to blasphemy. (Look at Psalms 105:15) Read Frazer&#8217;s The Golden Bough and also newer books by Earl Lee.</p>
<p>So, his name being CHRISTOPHER meant diddly s***. Why would a Christian give a sacrifice to Muslims in modern day? You&#8217;re not thinking clearly. The bible speaks a few times of human sacrifice(as does the Qur&#8217;an) and in a positive tone such as 2 Kings 23:20-25, 1 Kings 13:1-2, Jephthah sacrifices his daughter to win a war in Judges 11:29-40, and Lev 23:18 speaks of the sweet aroma of burning flesh being pleasing to god. It also speaks of killing those who are NOT Christian or who are non-believers (Yes, the violent Qu&#8217;ran does too) in Deuteronomy 13:13-19 which is actually killing and burning the entire town for one non-believer, numbers 25:1-9 commands you must kill those who are of other religions and try to persuade you, Deuteronomy 17:2-5 says kill anyone you find in your town worshiping other Gods, Deuteronomy 13:7-12 says you must kill even your wife, brother, sister, child, parents or friends if they try and entice you to serve another God, and 2 Chronicles 15:12-13 sates to put to death those who will not seek a covenant with the Lord. Why would they be sacrificing them to Islam? Makes NO sense.<br/>
I will post the second part when I have a minute or two.</p>

<p>Nick &#8211;<br/>
Part II<br/>
AS for it being symbolic and planned, that is paranoid and idiotic. Why was he there? &#8220;The State Department Accountability Review Board (ARB) reported that Stevens went to Benghazi on Sept. 10, with plans to stay until Sept. 14, to “reconnect with local contacts,” as well as “fill the staffing gaps,” because a principal officer there had left, and “to open an American Corners [library for U.S. books and other materials] at a local school&#8230; As Clinton noted in her 2013 testimony, there was no classified information in the compound and therefore no Marine guard presence, just three Diplomatic Security personnel, some local militia and a contracted security force on call. For added protection, she noted, the CIA annex nearby had heavy weapons.</p>
<p>Hicks indicated to the House committee that Stevens originally planned to go to Benghazi in October, but by going in September he might get fiscal 2012 funds to upgrade the Benghazi compound.&#8221;</p>
<p>The article continues: &#8220;Stevens was aware of the danger.Hicks testified that there were two planning meetings for the trip where security concerns shortened his time in Benghazi by two days, although he would still be there Sept. 11. It was agreed that there would be no prior announcement of the visit.Stevens took only two Diplomatic Security personnel with him, and so in Benghazi he had only five altogether, half the number of protectors he had when he arrived there in 2011.&#8221; Read more here&#8211;&gt; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/benghazi-was-familiar-ground-for-amb-j-christopher-stevens/2015/10/19/911c4674-767b-11e5-b9c1-f03c48c96ac2_story.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/benghazi-was-familiar-ground-for-amb-j-christopher-stevens/2015/10/19/911c4674-767b-11e5-b9c1-f03c48c96ac2_story.html</a><br/>
Dr. Anne Stevens, Ambassador Steven&#8217;s sister said, &#8221; He decided to take the risk to go there. It is not something they did to him.

<p>What you don&#8217;t seem to understand is that too much faith and reliability was placed on local militias like the Feb. 17 Martyrs Brigade &amp; Blue Mountain Libya(British firm who had a contract to help with security via locals), who were sort of trained , but not near to how they should have been, by US. Let&#8217;s look at the OFFICIAL MAJORITY INTERIM REPORT: BENGHAZI INVESTIGATION UPDATE &#8211; COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES FEBRUARY 2014:<br/>
Page 13-15 &#8220;The majority members note the absence of an imminent threat in Benghazi&#8230; In Benghazi, U.S. forces were confronted with the unexpected, and the committee is necessarily focused on how the nation’s military responded to this unanticipated scenario&#8230; State Department officials in Libya apparently understood the dangers. As noted in the Interim Progress Report, on several occasions in 2012 Ambassador Stevens and others at the U.S. embassy stressed within the Department of State the inadequacy of security in Libya and outlined the need for additional personnel.</p>
<p>In fact, however, in the weeks before the attack there was a decrease in the modest U.S. military presence there. For many months, there was a sixteen<br/>
-person Special Forces unit, known as the Security Support Team or the Site Security Team (SST), at the embassy in Tripoli. This unit was involved with protecting the U.S. compound&#8230; In a written exchange with the committee, General Ham said that he could “state with certainty” that after the SST drawdown, AFRICOM “did not receive any direction to provide U.S. military forces to augment security for U.S. personnel in Libya.”</p>
<p> In separate correspondence, Vice Admiral Kurt Tidd, the Director for Operations for the Joint Staff (J-3), echoed this point. He declared that “[f]ollowing August 3, 2012, when the Defense Department Site Security Team completed its mission in Libya, until September 11, 2012, neither I nor anyone in my directorate received requests for additional U.S. military forces to augment security for U.S. personnel in Libya.&#8221; &#8211;&gt; <a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/sites/republicans.armedservices.house.gov/files/wysiwyg_uploaded/20140211-%20HASC%20O%26I%20Interim%20Report%20%28Actions%20-%20Benghazi%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://armedservices.house.gov/sites/republicans.armedservices.house.gov/files/wysiwyg_uploaded/20140211-%20HASC%20O%26I%20Interim%20Report%20%28Actions%20-%20Benghazi%29.pdf</a></p>
<p>Your inerudite statement of, &#8221; He had no security. The Seals that were with him were not assigned but volunteered. He feared for his life all along. He was clearly ordered to go to Benghazi which was an unprotected consulate.&#8221; is complete nonsense and shows you care nothing for the truth of this issue.</p>
<p>When the attack hit, &#8221; there were five diplomatic security agents (DS) on site &#8211; three based in Benghazi and two traveling with Stevens&#8230; Although his first planned trip to Benghazi in the beginning of August 2012 had to be canceled because of security Stevens was adamant, however, about going in September. With the departure of the Diplomatic Security Agent in charge at the end of August,only two Diplomatic Security Agents remained to secure the compound.A Diplomatic Security Agent from Tripoli was routed to Benghazi to serve temporarily during the month of September putting three agents on the ground as of September 1, 2012. Stevens arrived by a commercial airplane in Benghazi on the morning of Sept 10th, 2012. Traveling with him were two of the six Diplomatic Security Agents assigned to the Embassy in Tripoli, four Diplomatic Security Agents remained behind at the Embassy along with four Dept. Of Defense special operators who had previously served as part of the Site Security Team [SST]. In addiction, the special operators had previously augmented security at the Benghazi Mission compound, but they were no longer able to do so. Patrick F. Kennedy, the Under Secretary For Management, State Department, terminated the SST&#8217;s responsibilities for Embassy security in August of 2012. As a result, the SST was not longer able to travel with Stevens or augment security in Benghazi.</p>
<p>So, to answer you question, we had nine people to draw from when Chris decided you know [Principal Officer Four] is chosen to be acting Principal Officer for the first week in September. And he goes to Benghazi and is there with three Diplomatic Special Security Agents, all of whom are brand new to the service and on temporary duty assignment. &#8221; This was from the official Republican Committee investigation &#8211;&gt; <a href="https://benghazi.house.gov/sites/republicans.benghazi.house.gov/files/documents/Part%20I_Redacted.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://benghazi.house.gov/sites/republicans.benghazi.house.gov/files/documents/Part%20I_Redacted.pdf</a></p>
<p>This last little nugget you vomited forth is almost ironic. You truly are a pedagogically impaired with a lack of executive functioning. You stated: &#8220;The killing was a pagan ritual killing no doubt overseen by an imam and observed via remote by obama and hillary. This explains their absence from the public view. It was done to atone for the killing of osama by obama. Symbolism is important to the low IQ and big ego muslims and this killing was full of symbolism including the name of the ambassador.&#8221;</p>
<p>Symbolism is important to the low IQ Muslims? I posted this at the top coffee shop in Colorado and it is getting a lot of head-shaking and much &#8220;oh that silly little boy. Poor thing&#8221; Sweetie, symbolism is important to almost all religions and cultures. The Abrahamic religions, which Judaism, Christianity and Muslims are apart of, have MUCH in common so son, &#8220;check yoself &#8216;for ya wreck yoself&#8221; because you are looking more foolish than a petulant child in a cereal aisle at the grocery store who has been told he&#8217;s getting Raisin Bran instead of Capn&#8221;Crunch and is stomping his feet and clenching his fist while holding his breath.</p>
<p>Also, Ego is not a bad thing, doll. Life without an ego would be&#8230;wow, you don&#8217;t know what an ego is, do you? Having an ego is a good thing when balanced properly with the superego and ID. Just look it up, FFS. As for IQ test and your nasty comment implying all people that are Muslims have low IQ&#8217;s, That is bigoted, ignorant and shows you&#8217;re not too bright, son. IQ test are basically bullsh**. Know what, go do a Boolean search, research all this but stop talking as if you&#8217;re clueless and emotionally troubled until you have a clue what you&#8217;re saying.</p>

<p>Just more jibberish to flow out of Hillary&#8217;s mouth. Deny, deny. deny. What&#8217;s it matter anyway ? If a photographer had pictures of Hillary going down on Wasserman, they&#8217;d both deny it, and lie about it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t care who is running as the Republican, it could be a toad for all I care. All I know is this woman should be in prison and she needs to be brought down and made to pay back any monies the taxpayer is out on prosecuting her!! We have got to get these rich wall street hacks away from Washington. Trump didn&#8217;t make his millions off the taxpayer like Hillary and all the others in Washington. They all need to be ran out of office and completely start over. There is a reason they are so afraid of Trump so it doesn&#8217;t matter who it is but someone needs to expose these so called elitists! Hopefully climate change will happen in D.C.</p>

<p>Cruz, like Clinton are tied to Goldman and probably many other big banks. Besides being funded by George Soros, and many oil producing nations! The whole federal government is corrupt, and we need to clean house .</p>
